# Elm Markup Examples

- `Basic` - A single file that defines a document and where the markup source is written in a literal string.  This should be useful to get you used to creating a document and rendering it.
- `Blog` - The same as `basic`, but with external markup files and a basic setup to use the `elm-markup` CLI.
- `Editor` - The same as `Blog`, except we've made a basic editor for our document.
