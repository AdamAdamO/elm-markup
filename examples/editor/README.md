# Building an Editor

Just like the `Blog` example, the files here are kept in `articles`, and our elm application is kept in `src`.

To start up this example, use 

```shell
elm-live src/Main.elm --open --start-page=editor.html -- --output=assets/editor.js
```

But! The exciting part of this example is that it shows how to build a basic web-editor for your document.

To do this we're going to be using `Mark.Edit` and `Mark.New`.
